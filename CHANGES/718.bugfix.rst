Fixed a bug where :class:`~frozenlist.FrozenList` could not be pickled/unpickled.

Pickling is a requirement for :class:`~frozenlist.FrozenList` to be able to be passed to :class:`multiprocessing.Process`\ es. Without this
fix, users receive a :exc:`TypeError` upon attempting to pickle a :class:`~frozenlist.FrozenList`.
